    "- The sampled signal is obtained in the Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM).\n",
    "- The signal is stereo (`nchanells=2`), but it is only used the left-side signal.\n",
    "- It is utilized 16 bits (2 bytes) per sample to encode the audio. The native data type of this data is `int16`, which is capable of storing a [range from](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/audioread.html) `-32768` up to `+32767`.\n",
    "- The data type is converted to `float` because of the numeric precision and because the floating point in `Python` [is interpreted as](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex) `double` in `C`, which is convenient.\n",
    "- The raw data is normalized by its l2 norm for each frame.\n",
    "- The original sampling rate is $44.1\\;kHz$. But each recording is downsampled into two different signals, with a sampling rate of $F_s = 22.05\\;kHz$.\n",
    "- The audio dataset comprises five classes (the speeches \"avançar\", \"recuar\", \"parar\", \"direita\", and \"esquerda\"), each with 10 recordings, totalizing 50 files. With the downsampling, we have 20 recordings by class. Considering that the `.wav` file is stereo, that is, `nchannel=2`, the number of audio recordings by class is increased to 40. From each of these recordings, it is extracted a discrete-time signal, which is converted to a $N_s$-dimensional vector, being $N_s$ the number of samples of this signal.\n",

    "- The AR(p) model is implemented for `p=10`, `p=15`, and `p=20`.\n",
    "- A single recording is divided into 31 frames without overlapping. The number of samples per frames, $N_f$, and the number of samples between each frame, $N_{gap}$, are given by\n",
    "    $$ N_f = \\frac{T_{sig}T_{f_{min}} F_s}{T_{min}} $$\n",
    "    and\n",
    "    $$ N_{gap} = \\frac{T_{sig} F_s-31N_f}{30},$$\n",
    "    where $T_{sig}$ is the signal duration, $T_{min}$ is the minimum signal duration of the dataset, and $T_{f_{min}} \\triangleq 15\\;ms $ is the minimum frame duration. All these variables are defined in seconds.\n",
    "- The Yule-Walker equation is applied to each of the 31 frames produced from a single audio recording. Being $\\mathbf{a}_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$ the $j$-th vector of the $i$-th audio recording, the matrix containing all coefficients of the AR(p) of the $i$-th audio recording is\n",
