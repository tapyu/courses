Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number.  There were 17 pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system.  Instances in this database are described by two attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic signal.\n","\n"," **Key features**:\n"," - Number of Attributes: 34\n"," - Number of Instances: 351\n"," - The 35th attribute is either \"good\" or \"bad\" according to the definition summarized above.\n","\n"," ---\n"," ### Question 1\n","\n"," - Estimar a matriz de covariância GLOBAL (i.e. sem considerar os rótulos das classes) para o referido conjunto de dados usando o método descrito na `Eq.
